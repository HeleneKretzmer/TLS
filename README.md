# Mouse embryonic stem cells self-organize into trunk-like structures with neural tube and somites

## Abstract
Post-implantation embryogenesis is a highly dynamic process comprising multiple lineage decisions and morphogenetic changes inaccessible to deep analysis in vivo. Here, we show that pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) form aggregates that upon embedding in an extra-cellular matrix compound induce the formation of highly organized "Trunk-Like-Structures (TLS)" comprising the neural tube and somites. Comparative single-cell RNA-seq analysis confirms that this process is highly analogous to mouse development and follows the same step-wise gene-regulatory program. Tbx6 knockout TLS develop additional neural tubes mirroring the embryonic mutant phenotype, and chemical modulation can induce excess somite formation. Trunk-like-structures thus reveal an unprecedented level of self-organization and provide a powerful platform for investigating post-implantation embryogenesis in a dish.

## Structure
This repository contains the collection of R and python snippets and scripts used to perform the transcriptomics analysis presented in Veenvliet and Bolondi et al. The main processing and data integration steps are show, based on which general visualization and plots of e.g. single genes were done.
A more detailled description and references for used tools can be found in the corresponding publication.

## Data availability
All scRNAseq datasets can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession code GSE141175.
